# Cosmic Tension Equation — Scientific Hub

This repository serves as the **central hub** for the development, validation, and communication of the *Cosmic Tension Equation* — a quadratic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) model designed to capture accelerating decline and stochastic variability in complex systems.

## 🌌 Vision
From **network complexity (Enron emails)** → **environmental dynamics (PM2.5)** → **climate tipping points (Arctic sea ice)**, this project demonstrates how a single mathematical framework can reveal hidden structures and critical thresholds across domains.

## 📐 Core Equation
$$
d\phi_t = -\gamma \, (\phi_t - \mu(t)) \, dt + \sqrt{2D}\, dW_t
$$

with
$$
\mu(t) = a t^2 + b t + c
$$

- $\phi_t$: normalized state variable (e.g., sea ice extent)
- $\mu(t)$: quadratic deterministic drift
- $\gamma$: mean reversion speed
- $D$: stochastic variance
- $W_t$: Wiener process

## 📊 Validation Filters
1. **Filter 1 — Data ingestion & normalization**  
2. **Filter 2 — Internal consistency (deterministic vs stochastic)**  
3. **Filter 3 — Advanced validation (benchmarks, sensitivity, robustness)**
