# ðŸŒŒ Cosmic Tension Equation â€” Scientific Hub

## 1. Introduction

Arctic sea ice decline is one of the most visible indicators of anthropogenic climate change. September, the month of the annual minimum, is particularly critical for monitoring long-term trends. According to the **IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019)**, Arctic sea ice extent has decreased by approximately **13% per decade since 1979**. Multiyear ice, once dominant in the central Arctic, has nearly vanished (Kwok & Rothrock, 2009; Comiso, 2012).  

While General Circulation Models (GCMs) provide detailed projections, there is a need for **lightweight, interpretable models** that capture both the deterministic decline and the stochastic variability of sea ice. The **Cosmic Tension Equation** (a quadratic Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process) is proposed as such a framework.

## 2. The Equation

```markdown
$$
d\phi_t = -\gamma \, (\phi_t - \mu(t)) \, dt + \sqrt{2D}\, dW_t
$$

with

$$
\mu(t) = a t^2 + b t + c
$$
```

### Explanation
- \(\phi_t\): normalized September sea ice extent (relative to climatology).  
- \(\mu(t)\): quadratic deterministic drift (accelerating decline).  
- \(\gamma\): mean reversion speed (how tightly the system follows the drift).  
- \(D\): stochastic variance (strength of natural variability).  
- \(W_t\): Wiener process (Gaussian noise).  

ðŸ‘‰ *Plain language:* The equation says that sea ice tends to follow a downward quadratic trend, but with random fluctuations around it.

## 3. Validation Filters

To ensure credibility, the model was tested through three successive filters:

1. **Filter 1 â€” Data ingestion & normalization**  
   - Dataset: NSIDC Sea Ice Index (September, 1979â€“2025).  
   - Normalized against 1981â€“2010 climatology.  

2. **Filter 2 â€” Internal consistency**  
   - Compared deterministic trajectory (D=0) vs stochastic ensembles (D>0).  
   - Showed alignment between deterministic crossing (~2036) and stochastic median.  

3. **Filter 3 â€” Advanced validation**  
   - Benchmarks: compared against linear, quadratic, ARIMA(1,1,0).  
   - Out-of-sample testing: train (1979â€“2010), test (2011â€“2025).  
   - Sensitivity: Î³ (0.05â€“0.25), D (5e-05â€“0.001).  
   - Robustness: stable across climatology baselines (1981â€“2010 vs 1991â€“2020).  
   - Reproducibility: crossing years exported to `results/crossings.csv`.

## 4. Key Findings

- **Median September crossing year â‰ˆ 2024**, robust across Î³, D, and baselines.  
- **Benchmarks:** Linear and ARIMA fit short-term better (RMSE ~0.08â€“0.09), but OU adds interpretability (threshold crossings, variability).  
- **Sensitivity:** Crossing years concentrated in the 2020s (2021â€“2034).  
- **Robustness:** Results stable across climatology choices.
